My slides from Coffee @ DBG are up now.

Front-end development workflow is becoming increasingly demanding as the complexity of the environment grows. Thankfully, there are many tools that can make your life as a front-end developer easier and perhaps, more rewarding.

The primary objective of this session is to get an idea about end-to-end front-end workflow and useful tools. We will discuss hot tools like Yeoman, Grunt and Bower. But the session is not limited to these tools - we will touch each phase of front-end development like boiler-plating, preprocessors, performance, documentation, code quality, reporting and architecture etc.
