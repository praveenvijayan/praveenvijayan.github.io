##Introduction

Linktomob created with an aim to share link between multiple devices without any hassles. Switching links between mobile and desktop browsers is a difficult process. We face this issue when building responsive site, mobile apps/sites or like to view site on mobile device when you are on a desktop. In such situations we will mail link and open it on mobile device. But if we want to test that link on a friends device or on a public testing device, in such situation sharing the same link on magnitude of devices will be a Herculean task.
