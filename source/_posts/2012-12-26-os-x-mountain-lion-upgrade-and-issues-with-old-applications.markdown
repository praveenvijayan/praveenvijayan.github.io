Today upgraded to OS X Mountain lion. It took around 8hr to download 4.37GB with my home connection. First glance its pretty impressive and it took hardly 25 min to install everything in my retina mac book pro.

Installation was smooth & fast.

After Installation I got an alert like this. Some programs are not compatible with OSX 10.8. Fortunately only program that is not compatible in my software lot was old Transmit FTP client.

NetBeans 7.1.x was not working with Mountain Lion. In order to work java applications properly, you have to download latest Java version from Apple. Select java preference using spotlight, new java version will automatically install in your system [java version "1.6.0_33"].

[NetBeans version 7.2](http://netbeans.org/downloads/) is available now for download. Which is more compatible with Mountain Lion. In order to install applications from other sources, you have to change a ‘security & privacy’ setting from preference.
